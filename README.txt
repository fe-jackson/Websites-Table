PROJECT TITLE: Websites Table

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
	This program allows a user to create and manage a table of 
websites and their information. While the program is open, they can keep track of 
each website's topic, url, summary, review, and rating. This program loads 
websites from an external file. It allows the user to add a new website and its 
info to the table, remove all websites with one-star ratings, display all websites 
of a chosen topic, and display all websites in the table. 
	This program was an assignment for a 200-level college computer science
class. It demonstrates the programmer's proficiency with using C++ to read from 
text files and to create ADTs and hash tables.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
	Compile and run the program. If you're using Linux, you can use the
provided makefile to compile the program. The program reads from a text file 
called "websites.cpp", which you can edit and add to if you want to start the 
program with more websites. 
	If you edit the text file, it must be in the following format, with "website's 
rating" being an integer representing a number of stars and with no lines in the 
text file skipped, in order for the program to work correctly. The format:

website's category
website's url
website's summary
website's review
website's rating
